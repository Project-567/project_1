## TO DO LIST
### As of Jan 30th 2020
- Short answer part [] 1 a) - e) ]
- Gridworld.py
    - create a class that replicates the behaviour of the MDP
    - should contain 4 functions
        - one to return the initial state of the MDP
        - one to return a view of all possible states
        - two to return the reward and probability of a transtition, respectively
- policy_evaluation.py
    - Find the value function of policy
    - Can use either an iterative method or solve the system of equations
    - Show the value function you obtained to at least 4 decimals
- value_iteration.py
    - implement value iteration to solve the Bellman equations derived earlier
    - run the algorithm with different discount factor
    - provide a complete analysis of result
        - short answers required
- policy_iteration.py
    - repeat the previous but with policy iteration
- Compare value iteration with policy iteration and answer short answer questions

# Assignment 1
# Four functions
# Function 1: return the initial state of the MDP
# Function 2: return a view of all possible states
# Function 3 and 4: return, respectively, the reward and probability of a transition (s, a, s') from state s to state s' when taking action a

def function1():

    # get initial state

    return initial_state

def function2():

    # get view of all possible states

    return possible_states

def function3():

    # get reward

    return reward

def function4():

    # get probability of transition

    return transition_probability
